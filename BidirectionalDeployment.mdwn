# Bidirectional Deployment
### Context

 * developing on [[Salesforce.com]]

### Forces

 * Salesforce development is entirely in the cloud: developers have no local environment
 * multiple developers often work in the same Salesforce org

### Supposed Solution

 * frequently pull the current code from Salesforce to synchronize

### Resulting Context

Developers never know where the true line of development lies: is it in [[VersionControl]] or [[Salesforce.com]]?  If the latter, which of the several possible sandboxes or developer environments is the mainline?

Developers feel comfortable making changes within Salesforce without committing them to version control, leading to a mismatch between the various environments.

Time is wasted manually integrating code.
