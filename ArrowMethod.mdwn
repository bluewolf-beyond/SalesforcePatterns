# Arrow Method

### Context

 * conditional checking and looping

### Forces

 * many conditionals need to be checked
 * nested data structures must be traversed

### Supposed Solution

 * put all conditionals and loops in a single method

    if (a) {
      for (b) {
        if (c) {
          for (d) {
            if (e) {
              doSomething();
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Resulting Context

Rightward drift makes following code logic difficult.  Nested loops and conditionals make code more complex, increasing the necessary number of test cases.
