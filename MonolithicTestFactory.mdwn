# Monolithic Test Factory

### Context

 * creation of sObject test data

### Forces

 * most tests across all projects require test data
 * required fields and validation rules necessitate specific test data
 * updates to configuration require updates to test data
 * most details of test data are unrelated to the test
 * [[FlatFileStructure]] encourages minimizing file count
 * all team members need to quickly understand test data factory
 * global methods are easy to invoke

### Supposed Solution

 * create a single test factory class for all projects.  make all test factory functions static methods on this class.

### Resulting Context

Many disparate projects put test data factory methods into a single class.  It becomes difficult to tell which functionality is related to others in the [[BigBallOfMud]].

Integration problems are likely when multiple development teams modify a single [[MonolithicTestfactory]].

Test code becomes littered with specific object creation logic, increasing the complexity of the codebase.
