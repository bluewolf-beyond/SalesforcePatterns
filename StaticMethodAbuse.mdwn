**Name**: Static Method Abuse

**Context**:

 * methods operate on groups of objects
 * only one instance of an object would ever exist

**Forces**:

 * functional code is frequently easier to write
 * object-oriented code is more difficult to understand
 * operations on primitives are more efficient
 * global methods are easy to invoke
 * object instantiation is expensive for a single method call

**Supposed Solution**:

 * make all methods static

**Resulting Context**:

 * unit testing is difficult
 * polymorphism is impossible
 * code reuse is more trouble than it's worth

**Related AntiPatterns**:

 * [[MonolithicServiceClass]]
 * [[MonolithicFactoryClass]]

**Applicable Positive Patterns**:

 * [[CommandPattern]]
