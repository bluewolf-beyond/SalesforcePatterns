# Anti-Pattern

An anti-pattern is similar to a design pattern in that it is a description of a solution to a common problem.  However, unlike a pattern, an anti-pattern describes a common but negative solution to the problem.

Common [[Apex]] anti-patterns include [[StaticMethodAbuse]], [[MonolithicServiceClass]] and [[MonolithicTestFactory]].
